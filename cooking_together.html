	<p>I draw cooking inspiration from a wide variety of sources. Because I lived in Hungary, I love finding and perfectin recipes to taste like my memory of the food shared with friends in Budapest. In particular, it is my life goal to bake as well as Hungarians. Their baked goods are simple but delightful. Many of my friends have lived and traveled in diverse countries around the world. They share the recipes they find. We love cooking together.
